# oculus-screen-recording
This a tool that allows you to record mp4 or animated gif of the Oculus gameplay *from VR*, no need to take the headset off.

The recording is currently activated by pressing the A button and stopped by pressing the B button.
There are also two keyboard shortcuts: ctrl+alt+r to start recording, crtl+alt+s to stop
When stopping the recoring, the tool automatically creates an animated gif version of the generate mp4 file.
At the moment, the application records the desktop but have plan to allow you to record any full screen window (would that help?)

I think being able to record clips of gameplay from VR is a must and thought of sharing this.
It's still a rough version so hope to get some feedback!

The recording is currently done by using FFMPEG, which is included in the zip file.
